Hi, Iâ€™m Sathvik Gujja, and I am a junior electrical and computer engineering honors student at The University of Texas at Austin. Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, you will find code from a variety of different projects that I have done, both from school courses and any other personal projects I have completed.
